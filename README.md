# README

I built this project as a part of the RoR course I took hoping to build my skills and land a software engineering position somewhere.

I'm using it for a different purposes so here's list of things I may want do add to that particular epic:

## New features:
- sorting and filtering messages.  Filter by category should be easy.
- this doesn't work on mobile...too much time investment; think I'd rather spend my time on Data, ML an Python.

## Bugs

## Todo's priorities:
- modify the signup process to restrict who can log in.
maybe as simple as a 'keyword' required to signup (could get fancier and make it a hash of some message I send)
- review existing functionality
- update categories - either CLI (in Heroku) or add functionality
