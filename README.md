# README

I built this project as a part of the RoR course I took hoping to build my skills and land a software engineering position somewhere.

I'm using it for a different purposes so here's list of things I may want do add to that particular epic:

## New features:
- sorting and filtering messages.  Filter by category should be easy.

## Bugs

## Todo's priorities:
- review existing functionality
